      "question_text": "\"The foresighted utilization, preservation, and/or renewal of forests, water, land and minerals; for the greatest good of the greatest number for the longest time\", insisted, Gifford Pinchot, a founder of America's conservation movement; should be the proper goal of greenery. Decades after he has penned those words, his sentiments still inspire.\u003cbr\u003eSadly, that is because the world's approach to environmental protection has mostly failed to heed Pinchot's call for wise use of resources. Instead, government every where have tended to follow a heavy-handed \"command-and-control\" approach that sets impossibly lofty environmental goals and requires needlessly expensive responses or rigid technological fixes. In America, these came In the shape of a wave of federal environmental laws passed three decades ago, around the time of the first Earth Day. Most of the world then followed the same path. The legacy of this \"mandate, regulate and litigate\" approach is mixed. It is true that it has helped to bring about environmental gains by most measures, air and water in the rich world are cleaner than-they were three decades ago. Yet, even as the actual air got cleaner, the metaphorical atmosphere has been poisoned by the Confrontational approach enshrined in such laws. For decades, the prevailing attitude of governments environmental agencies, especially in America, seems mostly to be hostile to industries. The resulting policies encouraged litigation and stifled innovation.\u003cbr\u003eDan Esty, a professor of environmental law at Yale University, says that the laws \"often looked disapprovingly at human activities and economic growth because of their harmful pollution side-effects, which were thought to be inescapable...prospects, for further progress on the same path is limited.\" He has been developing \"next generation\" reforms, which favour incentive-based and market-oriented policies. Greens and anti-globalisers may not like this; but the result could hugely improve the environment at a much less cost.\u003cbr\u003eThree principal failings of the status quo are driving the new green revolution-yesterday's failed ambitions, today's large price tag and tomorrow's even harder targets. The command-and-control approach has not proved all that effective in curing yesterday's ills. Although air and water quality have indeed improved dramatically, other environmental problems-from waste management to hazardous releases to fisheries depletion-have not.\u003cbr\u003eMoreover, these top-down laws are inefficient. This means that even the gains that the world has seen have come at a needlessly high price. Typically, the reason for this is that the laws have specified particular technological fixes so as to achieve outcomes that are pre-ordained, with little consideration for local environmental conditions or for the marginal cost of pollution abatement in individual companies. Another failing has been that of the cost-benefit analysis, a common-sense tool of economics that is suited to environmental matters, has not been widely used. Indeed in many case, America's Congress has expressly and perversely forbidden its use in environmental policymaking.\u003cbr\u003eThe most glaring example of what can go wrong has been of America's Superfund scheme, which sought to clean up toxic-waste sites through tough federal laws. For all the nobility of its aims, Superfund has proved to be bureaucratic, costly and largely ineffective. The scheme often sets so high standards (clean enough for toddlers in a theoretical nursery located on the site to eat the dirt, even if the dump was in an industrial park that many polluted sites were never cleaned up at all. The scheme invited litigation Superfund has cost billion of dollars,but over half the cash has  lined the pockets of lawyers. Worse, according to \"Superfund's Future\", a new book from Resources for the Future (RFF), a Washington-based think-tank; the scheme will cost America another $14 billion-16 billion over the next decade.\u003cbr\u003eThis dirigiste approach to the environment is now under attack not only because of its past failings but because it is woefully inadequate to the task of dealing with tomorrow's environmental problems. One reason is society's ever-rising expectations-the green goal-posts keep moving. Also, scientists now have a better understanding of mankind's impact on the environment, which often brings to light unobvious, complex problems. The link between an obscure chemical used in hair spray and a hole in the ozone layer, for example, or the relationship between carbon dioxide and climate change, are harder to understand and to tackle than the concerns of three decades ago, when Cleveland's filthy Cuyahoga river spectacularly caught fire.\u003cbr\u003eSlowly but surely, governments around the world are rethinking the command-and-control approach. Instead, they are tinkering with various types of market-based policies, ranging from green taxes to tradable permits to pollute. If they stick with it, such economic instruments would harness the power of the market for the sake of the planet's health. This could prove nothing short of a revolution.\u003cbr\u003eMarket-based greenery differs from the conventional sort in the respect that it tries to influence behaviour by altering price signals, rather than through regulations that spell out desired pollution levels or impose particular pollution - control technology. The great weakness of the conventional approach is that it gives companies so little leeway to meet their pollution targets. This means that they cannot respond to local differences and tends to lock in old technologies and stifle innovative approaches of improving the environment.\u003cbr\u003eRobert Stavins, an environmental economist at Harvard University, argues that market instruments do precisely the opposite-since it often pays to clean up if a sufficiently low-cost process or technology can be identified, such policies can prove to be powerful stimulus to both greenery and innovation. There are dozens of variations on the theme. But Dr. Stavins divides the market instruments into four broad categories-tradable permits, charging systems, cuts in government subsidies and the lowering of market barriers.\u003cbr\u003eIn a typical tradable permit scheme, the government decides upon acceptable levels of pollution and allocates credits for meeting those among companies. Those who can cut pollution at the lowest cost will have spare credits to sell; those with high abatement costs can then buy from them. Success to date includes the trading of chlorofluorocarbons under the international Montreal Protocol (designed to save the ozone layer) and the use of particulates trading in Chile.\u003cbr\u003eHowever, it was America that led the way. The greatest environmental success story of the past decade is probably America's sulphur dioxide scheme, aimed at reducing the acid rain. A decade ago, George Bush senior introduced this then-controversial plan, inspired by a trailblazing scheme in Wisconsin, to control and “ratchet down” the emission of sulphur dioxide from power plants. The key was the introduction of tradable rights, combined with a credible threat of punishment for non-compliance. This spurred the development of a vibrant market and lowered the emissions beyond expectations. Analysts at RFF reckon that as compared with doing the same thing using command-and-control, it has saved $1 billion a year.\u003cbr\u003eNature has provided greenery, to mankind for\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(1) beautifying his surroundings to give them a plushy touch.\u003cbr\u003e(2) his spiritual ascent achieved by meditation and rigorous exercises in self-discipline, which the sylvan surroundings afford by creating an atmosphere of calmness and solitude.\u003cbr\u003e(3) the utillisation, preservation and renewal of forests, lands, waters, and of times-the resources that benefit most of the people during many number of times.\u003cbr\u003e(4) using them as a cover for carrying on activities that lead to his prosperity, economic well being and overall supremacy at the cost of other animals creatures-and plants.",

      "question_text": "\"The foresighted utilization, preservation, and/or renewal of forests, water, land and minerals; for the greatest good of the greatest number for the longest time\", insisted, Gifford Pinchot, a founder of America's conservation movement; should be the proper goal of greenery. Decades after he has penned those words, his sentiments still inspire.\u003cbr\u003eSadly, that is because the world's approach to environmental protection has mostly failed to heed Pinchot's call for wise use of resources. Instead, government every where have tended to follow a heavy-handed \"command-and-control\" approach that sets impossibly lofty environmental goals and requires needlessly expensive responses or rigid technological fixes. In America, these came In the shape of a wave of federal environmental laws passed three decades ago, around the time of the first Earth Day. Most of the world then followed the same path. The legacy of this \"mandate, regulate and litigate\" approach is mixed. It is true that it has helped to bring about environmental gains by most measures, air and water in the rich world are cleaner than-they were three decades ago. Yet, even as the actual air got cleaner, the metaphorical atmosphere has been poisoned by the Confrontational approach enshrined in such laws. For decades, the prevailing attitude of governments environmental agencies, especially in America, seems mostly to be hostile to industries. The resulting policies encouraged litigation and stifled innovation.\u003cbr\u003eDan Esty, a professor of environmental law at Yale University, says that the laws \"often looked disapprovingly at human activities and economic growth because of their harmful pollution side-effects, which were thought to be inescapable...prospects, for further progress on the same path is limited.\" He has been developing \"next generation\" reforms, which favour incentive-based and market-oriented policies. Greens and anti-globalisers may not like this; but the result could hugely improve the environment at a much less cost.\u003cbr\u003eThree principal failings of the status quo are driving the new green revolution-yesterday's failed ambitions, today's large price tag and tomorrow's even harder targets. The command-and-control approach has not proved all that effective in curing yesterday's ills. Although air and water quality have indeed improved dramatically, other environmental problems-from waste management to hazardous releases to fisheries depletion-have not.\u003cbr\u003eMoreover, these top-down laws are inefficient. This means that even the gains that the world has seen have come at a needlessly high price. Typically, the reason for this is that the laws have specified particular technological fixes so as to achieve outcomes that are pre-ordained, with little consideration for local environmental conditions or for the marginal cost of pollution abatement in individual companies. Another failing has been that of the cost-benefit analysis, a common-sense tool of economics that is suited to environmental matters, has not been widely used. Indeed in many case, America's Congress has expressly and perversely forbidden its use in environmental policymaking.\u003cbr\u003eThe most glaring example of what can go wrong has been of America's Superfund scheme, which sought to clean up toxic-waste sites through tough federal laws. For all the nobility of its aims, Superfund has proved to be bureaucratic, costly and largely ineffective. The scheme often sets so high standards (clean enough for toddlers in a theoretical nursery located on the site to eat the dirt, even if the dump was in an industrial park that many polluted sites were never cleaned up at all. The scheme invited litigation Superfund has cost billion of dollars,but over half the cash has  lined the pockets of lawyers. Worse, according to \"Superfund's Future\", a new book from Resources for the Future (RFF), a Washington-based think-tank; the scheme will cost America another $14 billion-16 billion over the next decade.\u003cbr\u003eThis dirigiste approach to the environment is now under attack not only because of its past failings but because it is woefully inadequate to the task of dealing with tomorrow's environmental problems. One reason is society's ever-rising expectations-the green goal-posts keep moving. Also, scientists now have a better understanding of mankind's impact on the environment, which often brings to light unobvious, complex problems. The link between an obscure chemical used in hair spray and a hole in the ozone layer, for example, or the relationship between carbon dioxide and climate change, are harder to understand and to tackle than the concerns of three decades ago, when Cleveland's filthy Cuyahoga river spectacularly caught fire.\u003cbr\u003eSlowly but surely, governments around the world are rethinking the command-and-control approach. Instead, they are tinkering with various types of market-based policies, ranging from green taxes to tradable permits to pollute. If they stick with it, such economic instruments would harness the power of the market for the sake of the planet's health. This could prove nothing short of a revolution.\u003cbr\u003eMarket-based greenery differs from the conventional sort in the respect that it tries to influence behaviour by altering price signals, rather than through regulations that spell out desired pollution levels or impose particular pollution - control technology. The great weakness of the conventional approach is that it gives companies so little leeway to meet their pollution targets. This means that they cannot respond to local differences and tends to lock in old technologies and stifle innovative approaches of improving the environment.\u003cbr\u003eRobert Stavins, an environmental economist at Harvard University, argues that market instruments do precisely the opposite-since it often pays to clean up if a sufficiently low-cost process or technology can be identified, such policies can prove to be powerful stimulus to both greenery and innovation. There are dozens of variations on the theme. But Dr. Stavins divides the market instruments into four broad categories-tradable permits, charging systems, cuts in government subsidies and the lowering of market barriers.\u003cbr\u003eIn a typical tradable permit scheme, the government decides upon acceptable levels of pollution and allocates credits for meeting those among companies. Those who can cut pollution at the lowest cost will have spare credits to sell; those with high abatement costs can then buy from them. Success to date includes the trading of chlorofluorocarbons under the international Montreal Protocol (designed to save the ozone layer) and the use of particulates trading in Chile.\u003cbr\u003eHowever, it was America that led the way. The greatest environmental success story of the past decade is probably America's sulphur dioxide scheme, aimed at reducing the acid rain. A decade ago, George Bush senior introduced this then-controversial plan, inspired by a trailblazing scheme in Wisconsin, to control and “ratchet down” the emission of sulphur dioxide from power plants. The key was the introduction of tradable rights, combined with a credible threat of punishment for non-compliance. This spurred the development of a vibrant market and lowered the emissions beyond expectations. Analysts at RFF reckon that as compared with doing the same thing using command-and-control, it has saved $1 billion a year.\u003cbr\u003eWhich of the following would best characterise the author's logic on which the passage is woven?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(1) It is useless to force people to go in for environmental preservations, nature has her own devious ways of bringing the errant mankind to the right path and ensuring that conservation of resources takes place.\u003cbr\u003e(2) Environmental preservations should be the ultimate goal, nature's resources cannot be frittered away for short term gains, any ethical means toward this end is justifiable.\u003cbr\u003e(3) Industrialisation cannot be dispensed away with, the growth, prosperity and over all well being of the nation, is heavily banked on it.\u003cbr\u003e(4) Nature has provided man with resources whose usage is man's sole and I unquestionable right; other forms of creation have secondary rights, unwarranting to spare a thought.",

Already, the wheat buffer Mock has plummeted to an alarming 2.7 million tones (mt), well bellow the recommended minimum 3.7 mt, down from 12.9 just two years ago. Everything that the government has done in the 1990s - from exporting grain when the world prices were low and importing. When they were high, to raising procurement and issuing prices unconscionably - speaks of gross mismanagement. If this continues, we could soon have Pakistan - style food riots. Already the spectre of starvation and severe Undernourishment stalks the parts of Orissa, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan.

And yet there is an irresponsible talk in policy circles of \"unshackling\" non-basmati rice exports and aligning domestic input and output prices with international levels.\u003cbr\u003eOur food security should have been so badly undermined despite of the nine consecutive good monsoons speaking of a deep policy malaise and official, callousness. The nineties have seen, for the first time in nearly four decades, food grain output growth is lagging behind the population growth. Output growth has decelerated to less than half of the 3.5 percent rate of the 1980s. The slowdown is particularly severe in the case of rice and wheat, where the states that hold the key to marketable surpluses and account for 80 percent plus of procurement, have witnessed a fall in growth rates to just 0.9 and 1.6 percent i.e. well below the population growth rate of 1.9 percent. In our largest grain - producing states, paddy and wheat yields have fallen by 12 and 10 percent respectively since 1992. Meanwhile, the output of \"coarse\" cereals and pulses continues to shrink, eroding the food base of the poor, even as real farm wages decline.\u003cbr\u003eEvidently, 30 years after it was launched, the Green Revolution has run its course or exhausted its potential, especially in the agriculturally advanced areas. Northwestern India and parts of Andhra and Tamil Nadu show a clear trend of yields and output falling despite the significant additions of inputs such as chemical fertiliser. Although eastern India has done relatively better, it simply cannot compensate for the decline in the granary states. In India as a whole, there are steeply falling returns to investment and inputs. As land is increasingly diverted to non-food grain uses, grain I availability is further threatened. Given to the declining public investment in agriculture, all this spells serious food insecurity.\u003cbr\u003eWhy has this happened? There are several reasons. First and foremost, the Green Revolution has come up against the ecological and natural resource barriers. Its classic \"package of practices\" high-yield (really high-response) seeds, big doses of irrigation, fertilisers and pesticides - backed by loans and guaranteed prices, is simply not sustainable in a natural-resource-poor society. In Punjab, 85 percent of land has no j more groundwater left to exploit. In Haryana, water - logging and salinity affect S nearly a third of all land. In UP and Andhra, an overdose of chemicals is playing havoc with soil fertility. Farmers, who have oversaturated and killed lands with toxic chemicals, are now turning to nitrogen - fixing dhancha plants.\u003cbr\u003eSecondly, unbalanced fertiliser use - encouraged by the Rs.9,300 crore subsidy for urea - is playing havoc with soil health. The nitrogen-phosphorus-potassium ratio has 1 changed to 8.5 : 6.6 : 1 in place of the optimal 4 : 2 : 1. (In UP, it is a dangerous high upto 30 : 6 : 1). There is a severe scarcity of micronutrients like zinc, copper, iron and manganese. The National Academy of Agricultural Sciences report warns us of grave danger if micronutrients are not replenished and green - manuring is not practised. Fertiliser over use has been economically counterproductive too. Thus, fertilizer consumption has increased eight times over the past 25 years, but foodgrains output has not even doubled.\u003cbr\u003eThirdly, the Green Revolution's genetic breakthrough was largely limited to wheat and rice, which the official policy favoured while ignoring \"coarse\" grains (in reality, highly nutritious millets consumed by the poor). The result has been the growth of monocultures of rice and wheat and loss of biodiversity. This also means an inappropriate land use - Punjab and Haryana, whose climate is unsuitable for rice, have become its major producers. The Gangetic plains have turned into an environmentally unsustainable rice wheat cropping system. Another consequence is suboptimal use of water and overuse of power, neither of which can afford. The capital cost of major irrigation day is the order of Rs.50-80,000 per hectare-Servicing this annually alone would wipe out all profit from agriculture \"if the farmer were to bear the cost. But he doesn't. The state does.\u003cbr\u003eFourthly, in the nineties, the government deliberately changed its earlier policy of trying to keep food prices low. Following the premise that high output prices and subsidised inputs would attract more investment and make agriculture competitive, will double the fertiliser subsidy. The idea was to \"globalise\" domestic prices. But the premise is flawed. Our experience has been that, higher prices for a specific crop spurt 5i investment into its cultivation, but the aggregate supply response to an across-the-board increase in output prices; is very weak. Hence prices have risen, but investment, yield and output have not.\u003cbr\u003eThese process factors have resulted in a first-rate agrarian crisis. This crisis cannot be resolved by adding inputs, or promoting better fertilizer/pesticide use - i.e. more of the same. Dried land, which has less than two percent organic matter left in it, cannot be revived by chemical means. There is no way that our electrical system can support the current 10-12 percent annual increase in power consumption which water-intensive agriculture demands.\u003cbr\u003eA paradigm shift is in order. We need a \"Doubly Green Revolution\",-which judiciously uses advances in plant genetics and biotechnology, but is simultaneously resource - conserving, and environmentally sound. This means a transition from high-energy, chemical - and water-intensive agriculture to low-input, low-chemical, more organic, water conserving farming. It means altering the direction of breeding towards sturdy, drought-and-pest-resistant seeds based on indigenous genetic material, and away from rice and wheat to millets, pulses and grasses. It means moving away from monocultures to page agri-silvipastoral systems which recycle biomass. It means conserving energy. It means moving from big to small farmers.\u003cbr\u003eFortunately, we have a highly evolved agricultural research-and-extension system with the resources to undertake this transition. We must strengthen it and discourage capital and energy - intensive seed-breeding based on exogenous material.

      "question_text": "The grim crisis including a farmers strike over wheat procurement in Punjab and Haryana, despite 'a hefty 25 percent increase in purchase prices in a single year, highlights the deep trouble brewing in our food economy. Already, the wheat buffer Mock has plummeted to an alarming 2.7 million tones (mt), well bellow the recommended minimum 3.7 mt, down from 12.9 just two years ago. Everything that the government has done in the 1990s - from exporting grain when the world prices were low and importing. When they were high, to raising procurement and issuing prices unconscionably - speaks of gross mismanagement. If this continues, we could soon have Pakistan - style food riots. Already the spectre of starvation and severe Undernourishment stalks the parts of Orissa, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan. Our creaking public distribution system and its \"targeted\" variant, is in danger of collapsing. And yet there is an irresponsible talk in policy circles of \"unshackling\" non-basmati rice exports and aligning domestic input and output prices with international levels.\u003cbr\u003eOur food security should have been so badly undermined despite of the nine consecutive good monsoons speaking of a deep policy malaise and official, callousness. The nineties have seen, for the first time in nearly four decades, food grain output growth is lagging behind the population growth. Output growth has decelerated to less than half of the 3.5 percent rate of the 1980s. The slowdown is particularly severe in the case of rice and wheat, where the states that hold the key to marketable surpluses and account for 80 percent plus of procurement, have witnessed a fall in growth rates to just 0.9 and 1.6 percent i.e. well below the population growth rate of 1.9 percent. In our largest grain - producing states, paddy and wheat yields have fallen by 12 and 10 percent respectively since 1992. Meanwhile, the output of \"coarse\" cereals and pulses continues to shrink, eroding the food base of the poor, even as real farm wages decline.\u003cbr\u003eEvidently, 30 years after it was launched, the Green Revolution has run its course or exhausted its potential, especially in the agriculturally advanced areas. Northwestern India and parts of Andhra and Tamil Nadu show a clear trend of yields and output falling despite the significant additions of inputs such as chemical fertiliser. Although eastern India has done relatively better, it simply cannot compensate for the decline in the granary states. In India as a whole, there are steeply falling returns to investment and inputs. As land is increasingly diverted to non-food grain uses, grain I availability is further threatened. Given to the declining public investment in agriculture, all this spells serious food insecurity.\u003cbr\u003eWhy has this happened? There are several reasons. First and foremost, the Green Revolution has come up against the ecological and natural resource barriers. Its classic \"package of practices\" high-yield (really high-response) seeds, big doses of irrigation, fertilisers and pesticides - backed by loans and guaranteed prices, is simply not sustainable in a natural-resource-poor society. In Punjab, 85 percent of land has no j more groundwater left to exploit. In Haryana, water - logging and salinity affect S nearly a third of all land. In UP and Andhra, an overdose of chemicals is playing havoc with soil fertility. Farmers, who have oversaturated and killed lands with toxic chemicals, are now turning to nitrogen - fixing dhancha plants.\u003cbr\u003eSecondly, unbalanced fertiliser use - encouraged by the Rs.9,300 crore subsidy for urea - is playing havoc with soil health. The nitrogen-phosphorus-potassium ratio has 1 changed to 8.5 : 6.6 : 1 in place of the optimal 4 : 2 : 1. (In UP, it is a dangerous high upto 30 : 6 : 1). There is a severe scarcity of micronutrients like zinc, copper, iron and manganese. The National Academy of Agricultural Sciences report warns us of grave danger if micronutrients are not replenished and green - manuring is not practised. Fertiliser over use has been economically counterproductive too. Thus, fertilizer consumption has increased eight times over the past 25 years, but foodgrains output has not even doubled.\u003cbr\u003eThirdly, the Green Revolution's genetic breakthrough was largely limited to wheat and rice, which the official policy favoured while ignoring \"coarse\" grains (in reality, highly nutritious millets consumed by the poor). The result has been the growth of monocultures of rice and wheat and loss of biodiversity. This also means an inappropriate land use - Punjab and Haryana, whose climate is unsuitable for rice, have become its major producers. The Gangetic plains have turned into an environmentally unsustainable rice wheat cropping system. Another consequence is suboptimal use of water and overuse of power, neither of which can afford. The capital cost of major irrigation day is the order of Rs.50-80,000 per hectare-Servicing this annually alone would wipe out all profit from agriculture \"if the farmer were to bear the cost. But he doesn't. The state does.\u003cbr\u003eFourthly, in the nineties, the government deliberately changed its earlier policy of trying to keep food prices low. Following the premise that high output prices and subsidised inputs would attract more investment and make agriculture competitive, will double the fertiliser subsidy. The idea was to \"globalise\" domestic prices. But the premise is flawed. Our experience has been that, higher prices for a specific crop spurt 5i investment into its cultivation, but the aggregate supply response to an across-the-board increase in output prices; is very weak. Hence prices have risen, but investment, yield and output have not.\u003cbr\u003eThese process factors have resulted in a first-rate agrarian crisis. This crisis cannot be resolved by adding inputs, or promoting better fertilizer/pesticide use - i.e. more of the same. Dried land, which has less than two percent organic matter left in it, cannot be revived by chemical means. There is no way that our electrical system can support the current 10-12 percent annual increase in power consumption which water-intensive agriculture demands.\u003cbr\u003eA paradigm shift is in order. We need a \"Doubly Green Revolution\",-which judiciously uses advances in plant genetics and biotechnology, but is simultaneously resource - conserving, and environmentally sound. This means a transition from high-energy, chemical - and water-intensive agriculture to low-input, low-chemical, more organic, water conserving farming. It means altering the direction of breeding towards sturdy, drought-and-pest-resistant seeds based on indigenous genetic material, and away from rice and wheat to millets, pulses and grasses. It means moving away from monocultures to page agri-silvipastoral systems which recycle biomass. It means conserving energy. It means moving from big to small farmers.\u003cbr\u003eFortunately, we have a highly evolved agricultural research-and-extension system with the resources to undertake this transition. We must strengthen it and discourage capital and energy - intensive seed-breeding based on exogenous material. We must abandon the chimerical goal of \"globalisation\" and look at our own needs, endowments and knowledge systems. Such a paradigm shift alone can resolve today's agrarian crisis.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGovernment increased the food prices in the nineties with a view to\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(1) Have greater revenue to the exchequer to get away from the debt-trap.\u003cbr\u003e(2) Encourage farmers to go for cash-crops which is money fetching.\u003cbr\u003e(3) Globalise domestic prices.\u003cbr\u003e(4) Promote competition among farmers so that the production can be doubled.",

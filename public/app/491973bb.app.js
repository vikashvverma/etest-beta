You want to emphasize that you are in it for the long run and you want to develop a career there and that it's not just a \"5 month stepping stone\" type of a job.

After all, don't you want to invest your energy and time with a company that is going to continue to be successful and one that will help you grow?"},{question:'<strong>What does "collaboration with teammates" mean to you?</strong>',answer:"Drinking at the water cooler together is not the best example.

I bring this same diligence to my work approach today as well."},{question:"<strong>How do you feel about giving back to the community?</strong>",answer:"Describe your charitable activities to showcase that community work is important to you. If you haven't done one yet, go to www.volunteermatch.org - charitable work is a great way to learn about other people and it's an important part of society - GET INVOLVED!"},{question:"<strong>How has school prepared you for this job role?</strong>",answer:"Think back to how you've interacted with your peers to develop social skills, how you've worked with classmates on projects to develop teamwork and collaborative skills, how you've developed discipline through studying, how the courses have helped your creativity, and how the classes you've taken have impacted your analytical / problem solving / reasoning skills."},{question:"<strong>Describe your academic achievements.</strong>",answer:"Think of a time where you really stood out and shined within college.

Where have you shined?"},{question:"<strong>What types of books or magazines do you typically read?</strong>",answer:"Describe both your personal and professional favorites. If you happen to like professional books / magazines that relate to the industry of the company you're applying for - that's definitely worth highlighting."},{question:"<strong>Describe your vision of your perfect dream job.</strong>",answer:"Ideally, the role you're applying for either is that dream job or will help you get to it. If it's going to help you get there, describe the elements of that job role that you are passionate about so that it ties to the vision of what your dream job is. Be honest and talk about the type of work environment, management team / leadership, coworkers, culture, vision and products/services you'd like your dream job to entail."},{question:"<strong>What is your perception of taking on risk?</strong>",answer:"You answer depends on the type of company you're interviewing for. If it's a start up, you need to be much more open to taking on risk. If it's a more established company, calculated risks to increase / improve the business or minimal risks would typically be more in line."},{question:"<strong>Do you value recognition or pay more? Why?</strong>",answer:"Either preference is fine, but just remember you have to be able to explain why. If you say recognition, then back that up by describing how achievement really carries weight with you and how you like to feel valued in the work that you do because it validates that you're helping your teammates / customers and so forth. If you choose money, you can also explain that is important to you as validation and you can highlight how money is important to you because of your goals (financial security, providing for your family, and so forth). The key is to be authentic with your answer. However, if you say you value pay more because you're greedy - know that doesn't align usually to most company's values/vision."},{question:"<strong>Describe what a bad work environment would look like to you.</strong>",answer:"There could be a multitude of things to discuss here: Business ethics (wrongdoing), inconsiderate teammates, non-supportive management, a product that does not do what you're promising customers and so forth."},{question:"<strong>How meticulous are you with details?</strong>",answer:'Being detailed is important for many types of job roles. Typically you want to highlight how you\'ve done that in previous roles. Example: "Being meticulous is important to me. In my last job, I had to count the money in the register as a cashier to make sure it matched to the receipts down to the last penny." This was to ensure there wasn\'t any "wrongdoing" at the company by any of the cashiers and I was always accurate in my reports.'},{question:"<strong>How important is the vision of the company to you?</strong>",answer:"It should be very important if you want a long standing career. Remember, you're investing your time, energy and earnings potential into a company so you want to make sure it's a sustainably successful company that will grow with you over the long haul."},{question:"<strong>Do you have the ability to articulate a vision and to get others involved to carry it out?</strong>",answer:'If yes, then share an example of how you\'ve done so at work or college. If not, then discuss how you would do so. Example: "I would first understand the goals of the staff members and then I would align those to the goals of the project / company. Then I would articulate the vision of that alignment and ask them to participate. From there, we would delegate tasks among the team and then follow up on a date and time to ensure follow through on the tasks.
